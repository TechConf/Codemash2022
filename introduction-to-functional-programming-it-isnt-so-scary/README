This is for the talk [Introduction to Functional Programming: It Isnâ€™t So Scary](https://www.codemash.org/session-details/?id=284399) by Justin Pihony

There are breaks in the slides where code exhibits the points. You can see the code in the different text files (named appropriately), and some require the extra project for background setup.
